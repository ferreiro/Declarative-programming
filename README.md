# How to test?

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the Haskell interpreter:
    ```Bash
      $ ghci
    ```
3. Build the exercise and run the test.
    Example for exercise 1:
    ```
      $ :l exercise1.hs
    ```    
    ```
      Prelude> :l exercise1.hs
    ```   
    ```
     *Main> output_conversion (365*24*60*60)
    ```
      

**Note:** $ symbol means commands executed from the terminal
